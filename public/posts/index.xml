            <description>Hi! My name is José Ignacio González Cárdenas. Everybody calls me Nacho.
I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer based in Guadalajara, México. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked primarily with services written in Go. I have experience with fast, distributed, fault-tolerant systems. I was invited to participate as a speaker a couple of times in local Go meetups.
Traveling is one of my main passions. I&amp;rsquo;ve travelled through Mexico, Central Europe and some parts of the US.</description>

<p>Traveling is one of my main passions. I&rsquo;ve travelled through Mexico, Central Europe and some parts of the US. Looking for new places to visit, after the current pandemic is done. I like learning languages, my native language is Spanish, I am fluent in English and I am able to
order beers in German.</p>
