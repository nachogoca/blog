Hi! My name is José Ignacio González Cárdenas. Everybody calls me Nacho.

I'm a software engineer based in Guadalajara, México. I've worked primarily with services written in Go. I have experience with fast, distributed, fault-tolerant systems. I was invited to participate as a speaker a couple of times in local Go meetups.


Traveling is one of my main passions. I've travelled through Mexico, Central Europe and some parts of the US. Looking for new places to visit, after the current pandemic is done. I like learning languages, my native language is Spanish, I am fluent in English and I am able to 
order beers in German.
